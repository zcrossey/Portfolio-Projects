devices have a place in people's fitness and overall lives. With the ability to track activity, sleep, stress, and time, smart devices have an immense impact on how people approach fitness and their well-being. With this in mind, there is still a lot of potential in smart devices, as although they do help keep people motivated, there is still aspects of smart devices that people do not utilize or know of.\n\nWith this analysis, it will hopefully bring to light some important observations that will help the Bellabeat marketing team focus on certain aspects of their smart devices that will their devices more marketable to consumers.\n\n### Key Findings\n1. Most of the activity from participants came between 10:00am-7:00pm, with most of the activity coming after work hours (5:00pm-7:00pm). This can help Bellabeat in that the Leaf or app can remind the user to walk or run\n2. Participants on average had their more active days Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday - which is not good if most of the week they do the bare minimum exercise. The Bellabeat app could help give the user a summary of their total activity each week by weekday to show the user their activity levels. This can help them make adjustments, as needed.\n3. Going off the activity levels of each participants, the sleep quality of the participants showed that they did not get the recommended amount of sleep of 6-8 hours most days of the week. The Bellabeat app can send reminders to the users to go to bed in order to get rest.\n4. Going further into sleep, the total sleep records of the participants was concerning. It showed that the less sleep records you had the more active you were, but the more sleep records you had the more you slept in, leading to more sedentary minutes. The Bellabeat app can show an overall look into how a user sleeps each night, showing when they were in deep sleep or awake, in order to allow the user to make adjustments to their sleep schedules.\n5. The average steps taken by the participants was 7638, which is well-below the recommended amount of steps each day of 10,000. Although steps taken is not an overall indicator of health, it can help users keep an active lifestyle. In that way, the Bellabeat app or Leaf can send reminders to users to get up and move around.\n6. Most of the participats performed more light exercise more than rigorous exercise. The Bellabeat marketing team can target these types of users in that the Bellabeat app or Leaf is a great device for beginners to start their fitness journey.","metadata":{}}]}
